Use the [WordPress Comment Blacklist](https://codex.wordpress.org/Combating_Comment_Spam#Comment_Blacklist) feature to protect you from contact form spam submissions. Currently this plugin is only compatible with selected contact form plugins.

= Setup =
* Anti-Spam add-on for [Ninja Forms](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ninja-forms) or [WPForms](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpforms-lite).
* Login to the dashboard and open **Settings > Discussion**.
* Scroll down to **Comment Blocklist**.
* Enter some bad words, phrases or weblinks that keep bugging you. **Choose your blacklist words wisely!**
* Contact forms that contain any of these words cannot be submitted anymore and will show an error message.
* Optional: Modify the error message output in the Theme Customizer.

= Fun fact =
Spam emails are usually very annoying and affect work - and there is nothing funny about it. But did you know that the term Spam, referring to junk mail, was named after a famous Monty Python sketch?
